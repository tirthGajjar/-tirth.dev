      <h3>Wearing multiple hats.</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          As I have my roles mixed with project management and technical lead, I
          have to put in a lot of efforts to justify each responsibility.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
          It has been difficult but the it is one of the most proud things I
          have done.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>
        Dealing with the technical debt, while maintaining the feature
        development pace.
      </h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          RAx had a lot of technical debt, the team was focused on the AI side
          of the things, the user's side of the product suffered.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
          I had to convert the solution from a MVP like stage to a production
          grade system, and there were ton of challenges, one of them was to
          improve the system while maintaining the feature development pace.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>
        Defining engineering process which align with the end-to-end product
        development lifecycle.
      </h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          When I started out with RAx, there were no clear guidelines on how
          they prioritize the engineering tasks, I had to do a lot of trial and
          error with processes to achieve a framework that works for the product
          team.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Building the team with very limited resources.</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          When I joined, RAx didn't have significant financial resources, So, I
          had to find excellent engineering resources with a constrained budget.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>
        Training the team to think like a product person and not just as a
        developer.
      </h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          This has been an issue with not just RAx, but I have rarely seen
          developers think like a product person, have opinions in terms of
          design and experience. And it is very important trait of the product
          development team. It took a while but it works{" "}

        multiple teams.

        <li>
          I was responsible for suggesting and taking architecture decisions
          across multiple teams and services. Coordinating the progress was a
          challenge.
