**What user engagement is not?**

User engagement is not equal to usage. A social media related SaaS product may have users logging in every day. Whereas a budgeting tool might receive users once or twice a month. This does not indicate that the budgeting tool has low user engagement. Measurement of user engagement is subjective. That is why it is important to know what industry you’re in before serving the users.

Hence, user engagement is all about providing value to your customers.

Aka ensuring customer satisfaction.

There are some basic and useful strategies that ensures user engagement for all Saas products out there. Choose what works for your brand to fuel its growth.

    <h4>First impression and Onboarding</h4>
    <p>
      Simple yet smart first impressions catches the eye. Your first impression
      could be the cover page of your website or your advertising campaign. Once
      user is attracted by that, onboarding is your way to go. Successful
      onboarding gets your user on board for a long run. 55% of people say
      they've returned a product because they didn't understand how to use it.
      Hence onboarding is all about making user aware of your product.
    </p>
    <p>
      Onboarding can be done by making a checklist of things that the user needs
      to perform. It includes signing up, giving a tour and collecting
      information. Each product adapts a different kind of checklist. But to
      summarize, a good onboarding experience is simple, reflects your product,
      tracks progress and acts as a pioneer to user engagement. For more
      detailed tips, check out our onboarding article here.

    <h4>Don’t rush.</h4>
    <p>
      You might have a loads of features to serve your audience. But going slow
      and gradually exposing the features is a key. Don’t overload the customers
      as soon as they visit you. Remember that this phase is not about
      attracting but providing quality. Your customer has already visited you
      which means you have done a good job attracting them. Now focus on steady
      growth. Here, the use of step wise checklist works well. It is also
      necessary to notify any new features to the users.

    <h4>Message schedules and push notifications.</h4>
    <p>
      Regular communication in the form of scheduled messages/emails or push
      notifications helps to level up. Push notifications however used less in
      desktop when compared to mobile apps, leads to a daily increase of 25% of
      website traffic. In product messaging works as well. Humans have an
      attention span of 8 seconds hence in product messages and pop-ups are
      great ways to keep that attention up. These well written messages and
      microcopy encourages user to take actions thereby increasing user
      engagement.

    <h4>Personalization</h4>
    <p>
      An excellent use of data analytics is to provide personalization.
      Triggering emails based on in-app behaviour to solving their concerns
      helps build brand loyalty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such personalized content even motivates user to respond better and helps
      them provide a better service. Personalization is not only regarding
      content but also regarding your brand. Display customer experiences on
      your website and put up faces. This allows your target audience to feel
      familiar and build trust.

      they were 10 years ago. Hence, providing value becomes the sustaining base

      product.

    <h4>Role of social media and feedback</h4>
    <p>
      Be it B2B or B2C, being active on social media leads to online consumer
      engagement. Social media is a boost for all kinds of business. Optimizing
      features helps the business to get more audience and expand. But posting
      regularly and engaging with your users online is a great way to increase
      engagement of the users thereby fueling your business.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another fool proof way to ensure audience engagement is to collect
      feedbacks. It is really easy to collect feedbacks on social media
      platforms due to its diverse features. However, adding feedback forms at
      the end of your mails helps you to know what your audience wants.
    </p>

      all about how to increase user engagement for your product, it’s time to
