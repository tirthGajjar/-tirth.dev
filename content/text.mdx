As I wrote in my blog post titled [Learn In Public](https://blog.maximeheckel.com/posts/learning-in-public), I recently brought my attention to learning more about **NextJS**. Throughout my entire career as a Frontend engineer, I've solely focused on building client-side React applications without much looking at other solutions. NextJS, in the meantime, became very popular and I kept hearing good things about it and when seeing the different use cases of server-side rendering. I can now see myself using it in several projects, or for my potential future business endeavors.

If like me, you started learning NextJS, or need a refresher on the latest features, this article is for you!
